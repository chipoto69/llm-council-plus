# LLM Council Plus — MCP Server

LLM Council Plus exposes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets AI tools like Claude Code and Gemini CLI send questions directly to your council and retrieve deliberation results — all without opening a browser. Ask your AI assistant to run a full 3-stage deliberation, configure council members, or fetch past conversations, and it talks to the backend on your behalf.

## Quick Start

- Install: `pip install -e .` from the project root
- Register: `claude mcp add llm-council python -m llm_council_mcp`
- Use: ask Claude "check the council health" or "run a deliberation on [your question]"
