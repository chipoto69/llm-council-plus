# Choosing a Transport: stdio vs SSE

The MCP server supports two transport modes. Picking the right one depends on where your LLM Council Plus backend is running and whether you want to install anything locally.

---

## What is stdio transport?

In stdio mode, your AI tool (Claude Code, Gemini CLI) launches the MCP server as a child process and communicates with it over standard input/output. The MCP server process lives on your local machine and makes outbound HTTP requests to reach the Council backend.

- The backend can be local (`localhost:8001`) or remote (`https://yourserver.com:8001`) — you control this with `--base-url`.
- No extra port needs to be open for the MCP layer itself; only the backend API port (8001) must be reachable.
- Requires Python to be installed locally.

## What is SSE transport?

In SSE (Server-Sent Events) mode, the MCP server runs as an HTTP server — typically inside the same container as the Council backend — and listens on port 8002. Your AI tool connects to it over HTTPS, with no local process involved.

- Zero local installation: no Python, no pip, just a URL.
- Requires port 8002 to be publicly reachable (firewall, reverse proxy, or VPN).
- The MCP server and Council backend both run on the remote host.

## Side-by-side comparison

| | stdio (local) | stdio (remote backend) | SSE (remote) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Local Python needed | Yes | Yes | No |
| Backend location | localhost:8001 | Remote server | Remote server |
| MCP server location | Your machine | Your machine | Remote server |
| Ports to open | None | Backend 8001 | Backend 8001 + MCP 8002 |
| Security | Process isolation | Outbound HTTPS only | Needs firewall/VPN for 8002 |
| Best for | Local development | Remote server, laptop client | Shared team server, zero install |

## Decision guide

**If you are running Council on your laptop:**
Use stdio with a local backend. Nothing is exposed to the network.
```
Claude Code --stdio--> MCP server --HTTP--> localhost:8001
```

**If Council runs on a remote server but you have Python locally:**
Use stdio with `--base-url`. The MCP server runs on your machine and makes outbound HTTPS calls to the server.
```
Claude Code --stdio--> MCP server --HTTPS--> yourserver.com:8001
```

**If Council runs on a remote server and you do not want to install anything locally:**
Use SSE. Run the MCP server on the same host as the backend, expose port 8002, and register the URL in your AI tool.
```
Claude Code --HTTPS--> Remote MCP server (8002) --HTTP--> backend (8001)
```

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I use SSE locally?**
Yes. You can run the MCP server in SSE mode on localhost and point Claude Code to `http://localhost:8002/mcp`. This is unusual — stdio is simpler locally — but it works if you want to test the SSE path.

**Does SSE have built-in authentication?**
No. The MCP server does not implement token-based auth on the SSE endpoint. If port 8002 is exposed to the internet, protect it with a firewall rule, a VPN, or a reverse proxy that enforces auth (nginx with `auth_basic`, Caddy with `basicauth`, Cloudflare Access, etc.).

**Which transport has better performance?**
For individual users the difference is imperceptible — both add only a few milliseconds of overhead on top of LLM inference time. stdio avoids one network hop for local setups. SSE adds a network round-trip but saves you from maintaining a local Python environment.

**Do both transports support streaming responses?**
Yes. Both transports stream deliberation output back to the AI tool as it arrives from the backend.
