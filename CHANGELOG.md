# Changelog

All notable changes to LLM Council Plus will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **MCP server** (`llm_council_mcp/`): Expose LLM Council Plus as a Model Context Protocol server, letting Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients send questions to the council and retrieve deliberation results programmatically
- **13 MCP tools**: `list_models`, `get_council_config`, `configure_council`, `set_search_provider`, `run_stage1`, `run_stage2`, `run_stage3`, `run_deliberation`, `quick_chat`, `list_conversations`, `get_conversation`, `check_health`, `test_provider`
- **stdio transport** (default): MCP server runs as a local process; AI tools communicate via stdin/stdout with outbound HTTP to the Council backend (local or remote)
- **SSE transport**: MCP server runs as an HTTP server on port 8002; AI tools connect via URL with no local installation required
- **TinyFish search provider**: 5th web search option using TinyFish's free-tier Fetch API (5 req/min); requires free API key from agent.tinyfish.ai
- **90 tests**: backend TinyFish provider tests, MCP integration tests covering all 13 tools and both transport modes
- **`docs/mcp/`**: Comprehensive MCP documentation including transport selection guide, step-by-step setup for stdio and SSE, full tools reference, and real-world usage examples
- **`llm-council-api` Claude Code skill** (`skills/llm-council-api/SKILL.md`, v0.3.0): Installable skill for interacting with the Council via REST API without MCP — covers all endpoints, SSE parsing, error handling, and troubleshooting

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Docker support** (PR #5): Single-container deployment via `docker compose up -d --build` serving both frontend and API on port 8001. Thanks @kcelsi!
- **Docker healthcheck**: Backend liveness polling via `/api/health` every 30s with automatic restart on failure
- **Non-root container user**: Container now runs as `appuser` for reduced attack surface
- **`docs/` directory**: New structured documentation folder
- **`docs/DOCKER.md`**: Comprehensive Docker deployment guide covering environment variables, persistent storage, Ollama integration, reverse proxy setup (nginx/Caddy with SSE notes), upgrades, and troubleshooting

### Changed
- **CORS hardening**: Dev-ports regex (`5173|5174|3000`) is now suppressed when the built frontend is present (Docker/production mode) — same-origin deployments no longer expose API to external dev-port origins
- **Root cleanup**: Removed stub `main.py`; moved `QUICKSTART.md` and `TEST_PLAN_SEARCH.md` into `docs/`
- **README**: Docker section condensed to quick-start + link to `docs/DOCKER.md`; stale CORS description updated

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **Ollama Configuration**: Fixed an issue where the "Local (Ollama)" toggle was disabled even when Ollama was connected (PR #4). Thanks @patrickgamer!

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-31

### Added
- **Serper.dev Integration**: Google Search via Serper API with 2,500 free queries
- **DuckDuckGo Search Optimization**: Intelligent query processing with intent detection, hybrid web+news search, and relevance reranking
- **Search Settings**: Configurable result count (5-15) and hybrid mode toggle for DuckDuckGo
- **Query Intent Detection**: Automatically detects current events, factual, comparison, and research queries
- **Auto-save Council Config**: Council members and chairman selections now auto-save (no more forgetting to click Save)
- **Council Validation**: Prevent saving incomplete configurations (empty member slots or missing chairman)

### Changed
- **Improved Font Readability**: Switched markdown headers and model names from stylized 'Syne' to readable 'Plus Jakarta Sans'
- **Search Query Processing**: DuckDuckGo now automatically removes conversational fluff and adds temporal context
- **Search Provider Auto-switch**: Testing a search API key now auto-saves and switches to that provider

### Fixed
- YAKE keyword extraction setting now only shows for Tavily/Brave (DuckDuckGo has built-in optimization)
- Font inconsistency between Stage 3 (Chairman) and Stage 1/2 responses
- CORS support for additional frontend port (5174)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **UI Redesign**: New "Council Chamber" dark theme with refined glassmorphism

### Fixed
